## Basic Formatting 
### Headings 
- Frequently used on websites, magazines, articles and notices to draw attention
#### How to format a heading
- Preface the phrase with a hash mark
  
e.g. # Heading1
- Headers one and six should be used sparingly!

### Paragraphs and linke breaks 
#### Bold
- Basic element in text formatting

e.g. **Word** ("**" at the beginning and at the end of a phrase)  

#### Italic
- Basic element in text formatting

e.g. _Word_ ("_" at the beginning and at the end of a phrase) 

#### Combination of bold and italic 

**_Word_** ("**_" at the beginning and at the end of a phrase) 

#### Strikethrough 

~~Word~~ ("~~" at the beginning and at the end of a phrase) 

#### Inline Code 

## Lists
### Unordered Lists
#### Bullet Points 
* Word

#### Ordered Lists
1 Word

#### Nested Lists
* Word
  * Word
 
Note: More than three levels of indent and sub-lists should be avoided. Otherwise the text might become too messy. 

## Links and Images 
There are two different types of link types in Markdown. However, they render in the exact same way.
* To link a text: [URL]
* Link: (URL)

--> These are combinable with headers, bold text, etc. 

### Reference-style Links
* Reference links do not appear in the rendered Markdown

e.g.  
Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?  
    [a fun place]: www.xy.com 

### Images 
#### Inline Image Link 
![alt text](link)  
Alt text --> A phrase or sentence that describes the image for visually impaired 

#### Reference Image 
![alt text][Image tag]  
    [image tag]: link
