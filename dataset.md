### How can the two datasets be linked or compared to each other?

The dataset about anti-social behaviour orders from 2001-2013 shows formal court-level enforcement of anti-social behaviour between 2001 and 2013, while the ONS dataset reflects public experiences of anti-social behaviour based on survey data.  
By aligning both datasets by year, trends in enforcement can be compared with trends in reported experience. Thus is able to assess whether changes in ASBO usage correspond with changes in public perception.  
Because both datasets cover England and Wales, they can also be compared at a national level. Together, they provide insight into the relationship between criminal justice responses and lived experience of anti-social behaviour.

### What kind of research questions could be answered by combining them? 

1. Did ASBOs appear effective over time?
2. Are there mismatches between lived experience and criminal justice response?
3. To what extent does the enforcement reflect the scale of anti-social behaviour experienced by the public?

### What kind of next steps would be necessary to merge the datasets? 

**1. Identify the relevant worksheet**  
Since the XLS-dataset contains plenty of other content, the right worksheet and table need to be identified.  
**2. Remove non-data rows and columns**  
**3. Consistency Check**  
The datasets need to be checked for any missing values or inconsistencies.  
**3. Variable transformation and normalisation**  
Since both datasets use different variables, either one of them have to be normalised.
